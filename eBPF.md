## Projects
### Beyla
- [Github](https://github.com/grafana/beyla)
- eBPF-based auto-instrumentation of HTTP/HTTPS/GRPC Go services, as well as HTTP/HTTPS services written in other languages (intercepting Kernel-level socket operations as well as OpenSSL invocations).

### ebpf_exporter
- [Github](https://github.com/cloudflare/ebpf_exporter)
- Prometheus exporter for custom eBPF metrics.
- Motivation of this exporter is to allow you to write eBPF code and export metrics that are not otherwise accessible from the Linux kernel.
